<p>Welcome to my dwa15 Project 1 page!

<p>My name is Joe Smongeski.  Currently I work at Oracle in Bedford, MA as an SQA tools engineer.  We develop software test tools to facilitate automated testing of Oracle/Acme Packet IP communication products. (i.e. Session Border Controllers, Session Routers etc.).  Our tools are mainly written in tcl/expect, pretty much the de facto languages for SQA automation in datacomm companies, yet they are old and increasingly <i>less</i> utilized languages.  We also write in C and occasionally Java.  I'm taking dwa15 to catch up on the world of web programming, since it is increasingly becoming part of every software engineer's world!

<p>That said, in a previous life, I earned a degree in music from Boston Conservatory, with a major in Classical Guitar.  I'm pretty rusty these days as having a full time job doesn't give me much time to practice. Maybe I'll pick the right
  Powerball numbers soon so I can get back to playing Bach!  (Actually my second choice for a career was any computer-related work, so things have worked out ok!)
